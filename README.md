- 👋 Hi, I’m Ralph! (aka: @DevopsPleb)
- 👀 I’m interested in infrastructure as code, terraform (just about any Hashicorp tools), ansible, kubernetes and immutable infrastructure. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on getting certified with AWS, and I'm learning Terraform, Python, and Ansible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any IaC projects!
